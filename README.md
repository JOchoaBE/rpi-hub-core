# RPi Hub Core

A Python project for the Raspberry Pi. This project allows a Raspberry Pi 3B to act as a Bluetooth audio receiver in its current state. More planned features are being worked on.

NOTE: External GPIO components as well as specific Linux configurations are required to run the application correctly. This is a personal project designed to only run on my Raspberry Pi. You are however welcome to learn the inner workings of the application.
